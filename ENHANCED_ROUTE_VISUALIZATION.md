- Color-coded risk levels for each protocol
- Expandable risk factor nodes below the main flow

**Features:**
- Custom node types for tokens, protocols, and risk factors
- Smooth edge connections with visual flow indicators
- Interactive controls for zoom, pan, and fit view
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

### 2. Enhanced Route List (`enhanced-route-list.tsx`)

**Dual View Modes:**
- **List View**: Traditional route listing with enhanced details
- **Comparison View**: Side-by-side route comparison with sorting options

**Interactive Features:**
- One-click route selection
- Expandable flow visualization for each route
- Safe alternative suggestions for high-risk routes
- Real-time risk assessment display

### 3. Safe Alternative Suggestions (`safe-alternative.tsx`)

**Intelligent Route Recommendations:**
- Automatically finds safer alternatives to high-risk routes
- Sorts alternatives by risk score (lowest first)
- Shows up to 3 best alternatives
- Provides detailed comparison metrics

**Features:**
- Risk-based filtering (excludes CRITICAL risk routes)
- Visual indicators for trusted vs untrusted protocols
- Price impact and gas cost comparisons
- One-click alternative selection

### 4. Route Comparison Tool (`route-comparison.tsx`)

**Comprehensive Route Analysis:**
- Side-by-side comparison of all available routes
- Multiple sorting options (risk, price impact, gas cost, amount)
- Visual indicators for best route recommendations
- Summary statistics for all routes

**Sorting Options:**
- **Risk Level**: Sort by risk score (lowest first)
- **Price Impact**: Sort by price impact percentage
- **Gas Cost**: Sort by estimated gas cost
- **Amount Received**: Sort by output amount (highest first)

### 5. Detailed Risk Breakdown (`detailed-risk-breakdown.tsx`)

**Comprehensive Risk Analysis:**
- Overall risk score with visual progress bar
- Protocol-by-protocol security analysis
- Price impact analysis with risk thresholds
- Cross-chain bridge analysis for cross-chain swaps
- Detailed risk factors and warnings
- Actionable recommendations

**Risk Categories:**
- **Overall Risk Assessment**: 0-100 score with visual indicators
- **Protocol Security**: Trusted vs untrusted protocol analysis
- **Price Impact Analysis**: Visual thresholds and recommendations
- **Cross-Chain Analysis**: Bridge-specific risk factors
- **Risk Factors**: Detailed breakdown of contributing factors
- **Warnings**: Critical alerts and recommendations

## üé® Visual Design

### Color Coding System
- **Green**: Low risk, trusted protocols, safe operations
- **Yellow**: Medium risk, moderate price impact
- **Orange**: High risk, significant price impact
- **Red**: Critical risk, untrusted protocols, dangerous operations

### Interactive Elements
- Hover effects for better user experience
- Click-to-expand functionality for detailed views
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "reactflow": "^11.11.4"
}
```

### Key Components
1. **RouteFlow**: React Flow integration for dynamic flowcharts
2. **EnhancedRouteList**: Main route display with dual view modes
3. **SafeAlternative**: Intelligent alternative suggestions
4. **RouteComparison**: Side-by-side route analysis
5. **DetailedRiskBreakdown**: Comprehensive risk analysis

### Integration Points
- **Redux Store**: Route selection and state management
- **Risk Scoring Service**: Enhanced with protocol trust checking
- **Swap Form**: Updated to use enhanced route list
- **Dashboard**: Integrated into main application flow

## üìä Risk Assessment Features

### Protocol Trust Analysis
- Whitelist of trusted protocols (Uniswap, Sushiswap, etc.)
- Real-time protocol verification
- Visual indicators for trusted vs untrusted protocols

### Price Impact Analysis
- Visual thresholds (Safe: <2%, Moderate: 2-5%, High: 5-10%, Critical: >10%)
- Progress bars showing impact levels
- Recommendations for high-impact swaps

### Cross-Chain Risk Assessment
- Special analysis for cross-chain swaps
- Bridge protocol verification
- Additional warnings for cross-chain operations

## üéØ User Experience

### Workflow
1. **Route Discovery**: User finds routes through swap form
2. **Initial Assessment**: Basic risk levels displayed
3. **Detailed Analysis**: Click to expand flow visualization
4. **Risk Breakdown**: Toggle detailed risk analysis
5. **Alternative Search**: Find safer routes if needed
6. **Route Selection**: Choose optimal route based on analysis

### Key Benefits
- **Transparency**: Complete visibility into route composition
- **Risk Awareness**: Clear understanding of potential risks
- **Informed Decisions**: Comprehensive data for route selection
- **Safety First**: Automatic detection of dangerous routes
- **User Control**: Multiple views and analysis options

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Basic Route Analysis
```typescript
// Route with flow visualization
<RouteFlow 
  route={selectedRoute}
  riskAssessment={riskData}
  onSafeAlternative={handleSafeAlternative}
/>
```

### Route Comparison
```typescript
// Side-by-side route comparison
<RouteComparison
  routes={allRoutes}
  riskAssessments={allRiskData}
  onSelectRoute={handleRouteSelect}
  selectedRouteId={selectedId}
/>
```

### Safe Alternative Search
```typescript
// Find safer alternatives
<SafeAlternative
  currentRoute={highRiskRoute}
  currentRisk={highRiskAssessment}
  allRoutes={availableRoutes}
  allRiskAssessments={allAssessments}
  onSelectAlternative={handleAlternativeSelect}
  onClose={handleClose}
/>
```

This enhanced route visualization system provides users with the tools they need to make informed, safe decisions when executing swaps, significantly reducing the risk of falling victim to scams or unfavorable trades.
